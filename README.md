### My Coding Background

- I graduated from the University of St Andrews in June 2020 with a first-class MPhys in Astrophysics.
- During university, I gained experience working with numerical simulations and data analysis in Fortran90, Python, and Mathematica.
- I undertook a 13-week training course in full-stack software development at Futureproof from September 2021 to December 2021.
- I am now employed by Futureproof on a 2-year placement with one of their partner companies.

I like writing small scripts (e.g. batch files, shell scripts, autohotkeys scripts) on my personal PC to carry out certain tasks for convenience.
I also sometimes like to make spreadsheets for tracking various things like certain tasks/achievements or resources I'm grinding for in a videogame.

I have a second account on Github [here](https://github.com/Fellshadow) which I use for personal side-projects that I'd rather not have my real name tied to (for privacy reasons).
